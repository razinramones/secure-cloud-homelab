🧱 PHASE 1 — Local Virtualization (Week 1)
Tools

VirtualBox (free)

Ubuntu Server ISO

Tasks

Create 2 VMs

VM1: Web Server

VM2: Database Server

Network mode: NAT + Host-only

SSH between VMs

Install:

sudo apt install nginx mysql-server ufw -y

Skills

✔ Virtualization
✔ Linux admin
✔ Internal networking


------------------------------------------------------------------

What I did:

Installed VirtualBox on Linux Mint

Created two VMs:

web-vm → Web Server

db-vm → Database Server

Installed Ubuntu Server on both VMs

Configured network adapters:

Adapter 1 → NAT (internet)

Adapter 2 → Host-only (vboxnet0) for private subnet

Brought up host-only interfaces and assigned IPs:

web-vm → 192.168.56.101

db-vm → 192.168.56.102

Installed SSH server on db-vm

Verified ping connectivity between web-vm ↔ db-vm

Installed MySQL server on db-vm

Installed MySQL client on web-vm

Created MySQL user webuser bound to web-vm IP

Created MySQL database webdb

Verified SSH and MySQL connectivity from web-vm to db-vm

What problems I faced:

VirtualBox AMD-V error:

Could not enable AMD-V (KVM conflict)

Second network adapter (enp0s8) not appearing

Could not assign host-only IP

SSH from web-vm to db-vm not working initially

MySQL remote connection errors

111 Connection refused

1045 Authentication error

1049 Unknown database

No MySQL client installed on web-vm

What I did to fix that problem:

AMD-V / KVM conflict

Created /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-kvm.conf with:

	blacklist kvm_amd
	blacklist kvm


Ran sudo update-initramfs -u and rebooted

Second network adapter not detected

Ensured Adapter 2 was enabled in VirtualBox settings

Brought up interface:

	sudo ip link set enp0s8 up
	sudo dhclient enp0s8


SSH issues

Installed SSH server on db-vm:

	sudo apt install openssh-server -y
	sudo systemctl enable ssh
	sudo systemctl start ssh


SSH from web-vm then worked:

	ssh ubuntu@192.168.56.102


MySQL connection errors

Verified MySQL was listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0:3306)

Installed MySQL client on web-vm:

	sudo apt install mysql-client -y


Ensured webuser@192.168.56.101 existed and used mysql_native_password plugin

Created database webdb and granted privileges:

	CREATE DATABASE webdb;
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON webdb.* TO 'webuser'@'192.168.56.101';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Unknown database error

Connected without specifying a database first

Created webdb as the proper database for web-vm

Overall achievement:

Successfully set up a two-tier VM environment simulating a cloud architecture:

Web tier (web-vm)

Database tier (db-vm)

Established private network (host-only) for inter-VM communication

Verified SSH and MySQL connectivity

Practiced real-world troubleshooting skills: KVM conflicts, network setup, MySQL auth, client installation

Built a mini cloud lab environment suitable for future exercises like connecting Nginx → MySQL or simulating AWS EC2 + RDS




#1Jan2026

Want to do:
be able to login into this pc using ssh from anywhere in the world

Option
1. Port fowarding +SSH
2. Public IP +firewall
3. VPN (Wireguard/OpenVPN)
4. Tailscale /ZeroTier
5. EC2 Bastion (Jump Host)

Easiest :
Option 4

Best :
Option 3

Cloud-style option
Option 5

Going with option 3
--------------------------------------

VPN(Wireguard) - Self Hosted
Why is it best option?
- Full control
- Enterprise security
- Scales to multiple devices
- Same concept as AWS  VPCs

Setup
Home PC = VPN Server
Laptop = VPN client

-------------------------------------
